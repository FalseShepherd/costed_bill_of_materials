# costed_bill_of_materials

Small web application to generated a costed bills of materials from an input spreadsheet of part numbers and quantities. Pricing is done using an average of historical prices; these prices can be batch uploaded to the website. This was the final project for a software engineering class I took. As part of the process I taught my classmates how to use Python and Flask.
