# costed_bill_of_materials

Small web application to generated a costed bills of materials from an input spreadsheet of part numbers and quantities. Pricing is done using an average of historical prices; these prices can be batch uploaded to the website. 

This was a project for my software engineering class. During the project I taught my team members how to use Python and Flask.
