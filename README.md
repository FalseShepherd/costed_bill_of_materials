# costed_bill_of_materials

Small web application to generated a costed bills of materials from an input spreadsheet of part numbers and quantities. Pricing is done using an average of historical prices; these prices can be batch uploaded to the website. 

This was a project for my software engineering class where I served as the project manager. I taught my team members basic principles in Python, Flask, SQL, HTML, and Git.
